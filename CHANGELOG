    * Revert PR #46. It is still possible to override parameter classes but in a proper way.
    * Some default options for exchanges declared in the "producers" config section
        have changed to match the defaults of exchanges declared in the "consumers" section.
        The affected settings are:
            * `durable` was changed from `false` to `true`,
            * `auto_delete` was changed from `true` to `false`.
    * Adds basic_reject functionality to consumers. A message can be rejected by returning `false` from a callback.

    * Merged PR #13 removing the need for the ContainerAwareInterface on consumers.
    * `rabbitmq:consumer` now takes a `--route` argument that can be used to specify the routing key.
